summary: "A website I made about myself for my computer science class in high school."
---


In my senior year of high school, I decided to make a website containing information about me, contact information, and past projects I made in order to learn more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Below are the images of what the website looks like. I don't have a link to the source code as this was made a while ago. 

I made this website on my own, and used repl.it to create it. I had learnedd HTML, CSS, and Javascript sometime in my freshman year, but hadn't used it for a while, so I decided as a project I would make another website to refreshen my knowledge of these languages. I realized that I had forgot a lot when I was making this.

From this experience, I learned how to use javascript to implement interesting visual effects, as well as creating working forms that take in information. I also relearned how to create a website using HTML and CSS.
