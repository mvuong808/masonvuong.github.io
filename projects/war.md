summary: "A text version of the card game War I created for my computer science class in 2022."
---


War is a simple card game where a card deck is split to two players, and each player flips over a card and whoever has the higher cards gains both. If the cards are of equal value, a war starts, and each player has to place 3 cards as a reward, and then they place one more card to see who wins those cards. I created a version of this game in Python for my computer science class. The player can play against a bot (randomized) or another player (using the same device) , and tries to win all the cards. Below is a brief video of the game being played. I tried to add some formatting to the text so it would look more visually appealing. 

I worked on this project on my own and I came up with the idea as I used to play cards a lot when I was younger, so I thought it would be interesting to try and recreate it in Python. 

I learned a lot when making this project, as it was one of my first projects with Python, I had to figure out the syntax and functions while making it.
